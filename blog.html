                What sizing method to use when styling elements for responsive design
            </p>
    
            <article>
                It is better to use relative size when styling elements for a responsive website as opposed 
to absolute size because it lets browsers on different devices, customize the web page and 
its elements to their specific viewport. Styling using relative size also allows users 
to have a smoother experience while zooming in because the web page readjusts itself to make 
the content visible. It is important to note, however, that zooming out makes it tough to see the content, especially characters because 
their size gets smaller the more we zoom in.

            <article>
                16px is the default width browsers give to elements and not the actual size of any screen. When
a browser receives an instruction to set an element to 200px it changes the default value 
for that specific element and displays it on the screen.

                CSS3 changes
            </p>
    
            <article>
                The major difference between CSS3 and CSS2 is the introduction of modules. A CSS Module is 
a CSS file in which all class names and animation names are scoped locally by default. The main benefit of modules is the guarantee that all styles for a particular component will
be kept in one place and will only apply to that component and nothing else. The most important modules 
include: <ul>
    <li>User Interface</li>
    <li>Box Model</li>
    <li>Selectors</li>
    <li>Backgrounds</li>
    <li>Border Queries</li>
    <li>Transforms</li>
    <li>Text Effects</li>
    <li>Multiple Column Layout</li>
    <li>Animations</li>
        </ul> 
        Each of the modules above has a set of attriubtes and features that it adds to the css language. These include:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Box Shadow</strong> - One of the CSS3 new features is the box-shadow property that adds a shadow to an element. Instead of using multiple images around an item, this property lets you add shadow with a short line of code.</li>
            <li><strong>Rounded Corners</strong> - Before the release of CSS3, developers had to write long code to produce rounded corners. Now, it is enough to apply the border-radius CSS3 property to HTML elements.</li>
            <li><strong>Attribute selectors</strong> - CSS3 also introduced new selectors in addition to the ones in CSS2. Instead of applying IDs or classes for styling, developers can select HTML elements according to their attributes. As a result, you do not have to create unique IDs only to apply CSS rules.</li>
            <li><strong>New Color Schemes and Opacity</strong> - RGBA(Red, Green, Blue, alpha), HSL(Hue, Saturation, Lightness), HSLA(Hue, Saturation, Lightness, alpha), and Gradient Colors were introduced. Opacity which makes elements see-through or completely transparent was introduced and could be implemented by assigning the alpha value in RGBA and HSLA, a value from 0 to 1.</li>
            <li><strong>Element Rotation</strong> - CSS 3 also introduced a property called transform, which enables rotating Web elements on a webpage. As of now, if a designer wants to rotate of an element, he or she uses JavaScript. Many JavaScript extensions/plugins are available online for this feature, but they can make the code cumbersome and most importantly consume more resources.</li>
            <li><strong>Web fonts</strong> - CSS 3 also facilitates embedding any custom font on a webpage. Fonts are dependent on the client system and Web pages can render only fonts that are supported by the browser or the client machine. By using the @font-face property, you can include the font from a remote location and can then use it.</li>
        </ul>
